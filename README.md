Finger Dance Game 

Install the app on an android device with API 15 or higher. 
The app is for two players. It has options to play on a NxN matrix, where N can be 2,3,4 or 5. 
That can be changed to include greater values of N if required.
I tried to include the latest material material design concepts to make the look good and also be
user-friendly.
